## Assignment

Assignment 1: Develop classes to help the larger system.

Assignment 2: Applying Object-Oriented Design using Abstraction, Polymorphism
and Inheritance.

## Encapsulation

The Encapsulation in the BankAccount class was achieved by defining various
functions and methods. Firstly, I defined the private attributes like
__account_number and making it accessible by defining methods and
properties.

## Polymorphism

The Polymorphism helps to call a same function in different ways and
responds differently in different functions. For example, get_service_charge
responded in different ways when called on different functions.
